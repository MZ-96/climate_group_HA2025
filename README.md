[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

### Groups multiple climate devices into a single controllable entity (Home Assistant 2025+ compatible)

This custom integration allows you to group multiple climate devices into a single virtual climate entity, keeping full control over **temperature**, **HVAC modes**, **fan modes**, **swing modes**, and **presets**.  
It is based on the original `climate_group` component, updated and fixed for **Home Assistant Core 2025.x** (removed deprecated constants, updated API calls, and renamed to avoid conflicts).

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Full support for **Home Assistant 2025+**.
- Works with **heat**, **cool**, and **off** modes.
- Supports **fan_mode**, **swing_mode**, and **preset_mode** forwarding to all grouped devices.
- Aggregates **current temperature** and **target temperature**.
- Chooses the **most common HVAC mode** when turning on.
- Allows exclusion of specific preset modes from aggregation.
- Custom name and unit configuration.
- Keeps the **same YAML configuration style** as the original climate_group.

## üìú Changelog

### 2.0.0 (MZ-96 release)
- Updated for Home Assistant 2025+ (removed deprecated `HVAC_MODE_*` constants, replaced with `HVACMode` enum).
- Renamed integration folder to `climate_group_custom` to avoid conflicts with older versions.
- Preserves all features from the original component.
